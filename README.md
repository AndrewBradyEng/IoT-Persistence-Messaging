# Persistence Messaging
This repository contains the Node.JS source code used to perform persistence messaging from a BLE source along with database entries using InfluxDB and MariaDB databases in the Linux terminal. The web-based graphing tool Grafana is also used to display the databases information.

## Input
The input for this persistence messaging tool is a micro:bit board with a button. It uses BLE technology to send it's signal to the databases.

## Use Case
In this specific example, the project was built to demonstrate a wireless bluetooth step counter, however this use case can be modified to store any data taken from the micro:bit.
